=== Update Theme Service usage

In OneCX v6, onecx-shell is responsible for loading and applying the theme for the chosen `workspace`. When a workspace is loaded, the shell applies styles from the workspace configuration (see `shell-ui/src/app/app.module.ts`).

The `ThemeService` should now only expose the `currentTheme$` property of type CurrentThemeTopic from the `@onecx/integration-interface` library. All previous theme-loading logic has been removed from the service.

**Remove deprecated ThemeService members:**

* Remove `baseUrlV1` property usages
* Remove `getThemeRef` function calls
* Remove `loadAndApplyTheme` function calls
* Remove `apply` function calls


[NOTE]
==== 
These members no longer exist in `ThemeService`. You need to remove calls or references to them in your application code.
