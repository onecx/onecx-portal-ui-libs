== Overview

This guide provides comprehensive step-by-step instructions for migrating OneCX applications from Angular 18 to Angular 19.
As part of upgrading to Angular 19, you must update your OneCX UI libraries to version 6. This library update is not a standalone migration but a required part of the Angular version upgrade process, as OneCX v6 libraries provide Angular 19 compatibility and include necessary breaking changes.
