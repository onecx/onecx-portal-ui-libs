== Remove @onecx/shell-core

In version 7 of the libraries, the `@onecx/shell-core` package has been removed. Shell layout components and `WorkspaceConfigBffService` have been moved to the `shell-ui` application. All `@onecx/shell-core` imports and any related usage must be removed from your application. 

**Actions**:

* Uninstall the deprecated package:

[source, bash]
----
npm uninstall --save @onecx/shell-core
----

* Remove all imports and usage from the project

[NOTE]
==== 
The moved components and services are now provided directly by the `shell‑ui` application and should be consumed from there.
