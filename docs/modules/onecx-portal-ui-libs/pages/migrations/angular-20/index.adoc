== Overview

This guide provides comprehensive step-by-step instructions for migrating OneCX applications from Angular 19 to Angular 20.
As part of upgrading to Angular 20, you must update your OneCX UI libraries to version 7. This library update is not a standalone migration but a required part of the Angular version upgrade process, as OneCX v7 libraries provide Angular 20 compatibility and include necessary breaking changes.

[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites
