= Leverage Angular Guards

In v7, Angular 20–based applications can fully use Angular’s built‑in guards.  
OneCx supports the following guard types:

* `canActivate`
* `canDeactivate`
* `canActivateChild`

When configuring guards in your routes, make sure that you do **not** use deprecated string‑based guards or any non‑function values. These will be **filtered out automatically** and therefore ignored by the routing system.
