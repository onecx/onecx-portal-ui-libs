= Quick Start Guide: Creating a Web Component from Your React Application

This guide explains how to turn your React application or component into a reusable Web Component using the provided libraries. The approach depends on whether you are using Vite/standard React or Next.js.

== Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Basic knowledge of React
- Your React component or application code

== 1. Install Required Packages

Add the necessary dependency to your project:

----
npm install @onecx/react-webcomponents
----

== 2. Prepare Your React Component

Ensure your component is exported as the default export. For example:

----javascript
// src/MyComponent.jsx
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <div>Hello from MyComponent!</div>
);

export default MyComponent;
----

== 3. Create a Web Component Wrapper

Choose the correct utility function for your environment:

=== For Vite or Standard React Projects
Use `createViteAppWebComponent` from `@onecx/react-webcomponents` (see `webcomponent-bootstrap-vite.utils.ts`).

----javascript
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';
import { createViteAppWebComponent } from '@onecx/react-webcomponents';

createViteAppWebComponent(MyComponent, 'my-react-component');
----

This will register `<my-react-component>` as a custom element.

=== For Next.js Projects
Use `createNextjsAppWebComponent` from `@onecx/react-webcomponents` (see `webcomponent-bootstrap-nextjs.utils.tsx`). This function provides advanced routing and context support for Next.js apps.

You need to provide:
- A custom App component (usually rendering the current page)
- A routes object mapping paths to page components
- The custom element name

Example:

----javascript
import { createNextjsAppWebComponent } from '@onecx/react-webcomponents';
import MyApp from './MyApp';
import * as routes from './routes'; // { '/': HomePage, '/about': AboutPage, ... }

createNextjsAppWebComponent(MyApp, routes, 'my-nextjs-app');
----

The Next.js integration uses the `useAppHref` hook (from `routing.utils.ts`) to handle base URLs and routing context within the web component.

== 4. Use the Web Component

You can now use your new Web Component in any HTML or JavaScript application:

----html
<my-react-component></my-react-component>
----

or for Next.js:

----html
<my-nextjs-app></my-nextjs-app>
----

== 5. Build and Bundle

Bundle your component using your preferred bundler (e.g., Webpack, Vite, or Rollup). Make sure to output a single JS file that registers the custom element.

== 6. Advanced Usage

- Pass properties and attributes to your Web Component as you would with any HTML element.
- Listen for custom events dispatched from your React component.

== Troubleshooting

- Ensure all peer dependencies (like React and ReactDOM) are available in your bundle or as externals.
- If you see errors about multiple React versions, check your dependencies and bundler configuration.

== 4. Use the Web Component

You can now use your new Web Component in any HTML or JavaScript application:

----html
<my-react-component></my-react-component>
----

If you build and publish your component, it can be imported as a script and used in other projects.

== 5. Build and Bundle

Bundle your component using your preferred bundler (e.g., Webpack, Vite, or Rollup). Make sure to output a single JS file that registers the custom element.

Example with Webpack:

- Entry: the file where you call `createReactWebComponent`
- Output: UMD or IIFE format for easy inclusion

== 6. Advanced Usage

- Pass properties and attributes to your Web Component as you would with any HTML element.
- Listen for custom events dispatched from your React component.
