= Storybook Setup in OneCX (WIP)

When setting up a Storybook for a new OneCX library, we mostly follow the default setup instructions provided by Storybook. 

For an example of how we set up and use Storybooks in OneCX, you can take a look at the files and source code related to `@onecx/angular-accelerator` in the https://github.com/onecx/onecx-portal-ui-libs[`onecx/onecx-portal-ui-libs` repository].

A comprehensive overview of Storybook, its core concepts and how to get started with it can be found in the https://storybook.js.org/docs[official Storybook documentation].
