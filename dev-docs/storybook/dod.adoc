= Definition of Done - Stories and Component Documentation
This document contains some questions that should be answered to determine if a component is sufficiently documented using Storybook. The questions outlined in this document should be viewed as an addition to any already existing Definition of Done (DoD) in a specific project.

== Questions
. Will the component be used in multiple places and/or by external teams?
.. Yes: Continue with the next question.
.. No: The component does not need to be documented using Storybook.
. Does the component folder already contain a `storybook` folder with a story file?
.. Yes: Continue with the next question.
.. No: Create a `storybook` folder in the component folder and add a file called `ComponentName.component.stories.ts` (e.g. `button.component.stories.ts`).
. Does the story file contain all necessary boilerplate code and a "Base" story that allows for the dynamic modification of all component inputs through the Storybook "Controls" feature?
.. Yes: Continue with the next question.
.. No: Add the necessary boilerplate code and a "Base" story fulfilling the requirements outlined in the question.
. Are all component outputs/event emitters captured in the "Actions" tab of Storybook?
.. Yes: Continue with the next question.
.. No: Specify argTypes for all outputs/event emitters in the story file to capture them in the "Actions" tab.
. Does the story file contain stories for all commonly used states/variations of the component? Edge cases or less common use cases can be omitted as they are taken care of by the "Base" story and the Storybook "Controls" feature.
.. Yes: The component is sufficiently documented using Storybook.
.. No: Add stories for all commonly used states/variations of the component.
