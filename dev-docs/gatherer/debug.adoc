= How to debug Gatherer

After running the following command in your web browser's DevTools console:

```
window['@onecx/accelerator'].gatherer ??= {debug:['name_of_the_gatherer', ...]}
```

you will start seeing debug logs for the specified Gatherer in the console. You can add more Gatherer names to the array to monitor multiple Gatherers.
