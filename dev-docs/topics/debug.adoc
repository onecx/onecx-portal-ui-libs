= How to debug Topics

After running the following command in your web browser's DevTools console:

```
window['@onecx/accelerator'].topic ??= {debug:['name_of_the_topic', ...]}
```

you will start seeing debug logs such as timestamps and data for the specified Topic in the console. You can add more Topic names to the array to monitor multiple Topics.
